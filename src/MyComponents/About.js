                Airline reservation systems (ARS) are systems that allow an
                airline to sell their inventory (seats). It contains information
                on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations
                (or passenger name records) and of tickets issued (if
                applicable). ARSs are part of passenger service systems (PSS),
                which are applications supporting the direct contact with the
                passenger.
